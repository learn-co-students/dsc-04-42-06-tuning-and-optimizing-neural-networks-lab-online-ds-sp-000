    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've discussed some regularization, initialization and optimization techniques, its time to synthesize those concepts into a cohesive modeling pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this pipeline, yoiu will not only fit an initial model but will also attempt to set various hyperparameters for regularization techniques. Your final model selection will pertain to the test metrics across these models. This will more naturally simulate a problem you might be faced with in practice, and the various modelling decisions you are apt to encounter along the way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our end objective is to achieve a balance between overfitting and underfitting. We've discussed the bias variance tradeoff, and the role of regularization in order to reduce overfitting on training data and improving generalization to new cases. Common frameworks for such a procedure include train/validate/test methodology when data is plentiful, and K-folds cross-validation for smaller, more limited datasets. In this lab, you'll perform the latter, as the dataset in question is fairly limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a K-folds cross validation modelling pipeline\n",
    "* Apply normalization as a preprocessing technique\n",
    "* Apply regularization techniques to improve your model's generalization\n",
    "* Choose an appropriate optimization strategy "
